# Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks

## The original code by the author is [here](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix). We have used a simplied version, obtained from [here](https://github.com/aitorzip/PyTorch-CycleGAN) and adapted accoding to our need.
